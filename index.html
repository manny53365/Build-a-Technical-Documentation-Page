                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <p>This section will focus on the HTML element of main</p><br>
                <p>The HTML "main" element represents the dominant content of the "body" of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.</p>
                <li>The <code>main</code> html element must contain opening and closing tags. </li>

                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <p>This section will focus on the CSS element of text-align</p><br>
                <p>The text-align CSS property sets the horizontal alignment of a block element or table-cell box. This means it works like vertical-align but in the horizontal direction.</p>
                <li>The <code>text-align</code> valid values and details can be found <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

                <h2 id="JavaScript_and_Java">JavaScript and Java</h2>
                <p>This section will focus on the difference between Java and JavaScript</p><br>
                <p>In a nutshell, when it comes to how each language is used, Java is typically used for all server side development, while JavaScript is reserved for developing client side scripts for functions like validation and interactivity.</p>
                <li>One of the many code elements of JavaScript is <code>eval()</code> more examples for JavaScript and Java can be found <a href="https://devdocs.io/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

                <h2>Python</h2><p></p>
                <p>This section will focus on Python</p><br>
                <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. </p>
                <li>For a boolean example <code>x + y</code> python would return the sum of x and y.</li>

            <section id="five">
                <h2>C#</h2>
                <p>This section will focus on C#</p><br>
                <p>C# can be used to create almost anything but is particularly strong at building Windows desktop applications and games. C# can also be used to develop web applications and has become increasingly popular for mobile development too.</p>
                <li>The <code>time.h</code> has many functions/values which can be found <a href="https://devdocs.io/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
